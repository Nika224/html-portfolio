<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nika, I am 26 years old and am an electronics and
  computer science engineer.</p>

<p>I've lived in Split my whole life, but while I was in college I went to Canary Islands for few months thanks to the Erasmus+ Project.
  Since I was in elementary school I loved maths and logic problems so me going to an engineering faculty was no surpise.

<p>I don't have many hobbies, I paint, play sudoku and walk with my dog.</p>
